It seems like most of the lawn questions (species, insects, weeds, sun/shade, watering, fertilization, etc.) have more in common with other gardening questions than with other home-improvement questions.

Generally, you should not assume that the reader has read or will read the other answers.

Instead, make a new answer that is as full and good as possible.  It's OK to restate something that has already been pointed out in another answer, especially if it's something you knew already or could have learned as part of your research for answering the question.

Are we a **Home Improvement** community or a **DIY** community?  It seems like the questions are all leaning toward home improvement, and DIY ones are discouraged.  Since the site url is DIY, but the name is Home Improvement, it makes it even more confusing.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me, there is a big difference.  *Home Improvement* would be questions directly related to your physical home, and potentially items in the home that are permanent.  *DIY* implies it is for people that like to do things themselves, not just related to your home.  *Handyman* may be another term more synonymous with DYI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some example questions that I would consider *DIY*, that may not fit under the *Home Improvement* umbrella:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - What should I use for a stable base for a 10x12 wood shed I am building?&#xD;&#xA; - What tool tools and equipment do I need to dovetail joints for an end table I am making?&#xD;&#xA; - How do I fix the leg of my dining room table that broke?&#xD;&#xA; - What is the best material to make a picnic table out of?&#xD;&#xA; - A hardwood tree fell in my yard and I cut it up for firewood, how do I store it correctly to season it for firewood?&#xD;&#xA; - What combination of bedding mix should I use for my raised bed garden (square foot garden)?&#xD;&#xA; - What's the best way to hang my large LCD HD television to the wall?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those are just a few, I am sure we can come up with others.  Looking at the questions from the [original proposal on Area 51][1], i see both types of questions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Seeing that the site is not showing a lot of growth and we are having a hard time getting enough questions, perhaps we need to broaden the scope a little bit.

The law question here is mostly of concern to DIYers and home improvement specialists. To draw a parallel from the startups site, there are a lot of state specific corporation formation questions asked there. However, in that case state level is much bigger than county level, and questions are limited to specif geographies where startups tend to be formed or incorporated (NY, CA, DE, and NV).

Anything to bring in more traffic to the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, we need more people to [answer this question][1] signalling their intent to commit to the blog. When we have enough, we'll get this site a blog and be able to share our DIY/Home Improvement projects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until then, I had an idea:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Once-a-Week Project Updates ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was thinking about this: one of the ways we can demonstrate our commitment to a blog is to, well, start a blog in chat. I was thinking we could start a room dedicated to Project Updates (Photography.SE has multiple chat rooms, as do a number of other SE sites) and have a day -- say, Thursday! -- where people come in all day and post pictures, horror stories, success stories, and others can ask questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Why a Chat? ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two reasons. First, it was pointed out in the lead-up to the chat that our site lacks some of the &quot;chatter&quot; of other forums, like DIYchatroom. Chat is where such chatter (pardon the redundancy) is supposed to go. However, as consistently evidenced by our main chatroom for the last few weeks, we are not a very talkative bunch much of the time. That's *fine* and totally cool...except it also means we're losing out on keeping people around who want something we actually can offer! A once-a-week event would require promotion on our part for a few weeks until it was an established event that could have a life of its own. This will also (hopefully) encourage more users to swing by into our main DIY chat. We're cool people, I swear!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, if this once-a-week chat were to turn into a large, consistent thing, we as a community could point to it as reason enough for us to get a blog. If it's active -- lots of participants, lots of people asking questions for tips and then the community moving those questions into the main site -- it could really be a valuable resource to us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/questions/325/is-it-time-for-a-home-improvement-blog" />

Should we sponsor an episode of a certain podcast, or even try to be a guest on it? Are ads even the right thing for us to do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. **Making Flyers and Cards for Distribution** -- Gaming, in particular, has mentioned that they'd like flyers and cards and stuff that they can distribute to local stores and tack up on community boards to promote the site. Should we have something similar? The designs are sort of pre-existing and wouldn't require much time to produce. I know we have a template(ish) for business cards that are DIY specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. **Trade Show Presences** -- I'm looking into potentially having DIY.SE have a presence at various trade shows for builders and professional renovators. Do you feel this is the right avenue to pursue? Are there specific trade shows you all feel we should be attending? Are there any geographic biases that you're worried would arise from this? Is this the right audience for our site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. **Tool Reviews** -- I mentioned this in the [other post I made recently][8], but one thing I'm considering is sending our users some shiny new gadget for them to use, review, and ask/answer questions about its use and performance. We have a number of X vs Y questions on the site on topics ranging from siding to caulk. Would this be something valuable to the site? Is this even something our site really should be doing?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. **Something Else!** -- If you have any other ideas, make an answer and tell me! This is *your* site and I want to do things that *you all* want me to do/pursue. Ultimately, I'm not the one who'll have to manage new users and answer questions. That's you guys!

Are ads even the right thing for us to do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. **Making Flyers and Cards for Distribution** -- Gaming, in particular, has mentioned that they'd like flyers and cards and stuff that they can distribute to local stores and tack up on community boards to promote the site. Should we have something similar? The designs are sort of pre-existing and wouldn't require much time to produce. I know we have a template(ish) for business cards that are DIY specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. **Trade Show Presences** -- I'm looking into potentially having DIY.SE have a presence at various trade shows for builders and professional renovators. Do you feel this is the right avenue to pursue? Are there specific trade shows you all feel we should be attending? Are there any geographic biases that you're worried would arise from this? Is this the right audience for our site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. **Tool Reviews** -- I mentioned this in the [other post I made recently][8], but one thing I'm considering is sending our users some shiny new gadget for them to use, review, and ask/answer questions about its use and performance. We have a number of X vs Y questions on the site on topics ranging from siding to caulk. Would this be something valuable to the site? Is this even something our site really should be doing?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. **Something Else!** -- If you have any other ideas, make an answer and tell me! This is *your* site and I want to do things that *you all* want me to do/pursue. Ultimately, I'm not the one who'll have to manage new users and answer questions. That's you guys! Silence isn't golden in this scenario; it's rusted aluminum siding circa 1970! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More importantly, it's important that us CHAOS people make sure you guys are always aware of what we're doing. If you ever have ***ANY*** questions about what I'm doing at any given time, just ping me in chat and I'll be more than happy to blather on about what I've accomplished...or whine about what I haven't. :D&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/questions/345/who-is-aarthi-devanathan-and-why-is-she-changing-so-many-posts&#xD;&#xA; [2]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/111/conversation/diy-site-promotion-chat&#xD;&#xA; [3]: http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/questions/325/is-it-time-for-a-home-improvement-blog&#xD;&#xA; [4]: http://www.sears.com/shc/s/s_10153_12605_Tools_Hand+Tools_Screwdrivers?sbf=Brand&amp;sbv=Craftsman&amp;sid=ISx20070515x00001a&amp;psid=21x1306018&#xD;&#xA; [5]: http://www.younghouselove.com/&#xD;&#xA; [6]: http://joeyandlana.com/&#xD;&#xA; [7]: http://askthebuilder.com/&#xD;&#xA; [8]: http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/questions/361/what-kinds-of-products-would-you-like-to-try-out-and-ask-about-on-this-site" />

Then once the contest starts, unless you had a project in mind, it may be difficult to get an inspiration from a pile of materials.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a fix this disaster (like a hole in the floor) with limited materials, then we may end up promoting a &quot;hack&quot; fix, which is in conflict with the spirit on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So my thinking is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* We need to focus the contest into a problem that can be solved.  This fits the general tone of the site - I have this problem, how do I fix it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* We need a problem that's too broad to be a normal question.

I liked BMitch's small parts storage tip.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some sort of planter/garden contraption.

In this case the Community user bumps the question for you. In this case it would be sensible to check the existing answers and if they are good up-vote at least one of them.

People could sign up on meta and each month we set up a chat room for it? The normal chat bunch helps walk whomever through it over a few days and then someone recaps the chat for the blog?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So for instance, we had a conversation about insulating an attic in the last Project Update Thursday chat.  With that use case, the OP (Aaron) could sign up on meta.  A chat room (or the existing one) would be created to capture the conversation.  In the chat we covered questions like:  How high are your joists, what's already there, what do you want to do with the space?  The OP can tackle those questions, take pictures, and come back.  Joists are 8 inches high, 1 inch of spun fiberglass in the cavity, plywood covering the joists, want to store christmas ornaments up there.  Then we talk structure, new insulation material, target R value, other concerns.  I figure this could take a bit of back and forth depending on what's involved.  Once the plan is put together, a blog contributor writes up the plan and puts it on the blog.  As a thank you, the OP takes pictures of the work and contributes to a follow up post detailing how it went.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My main focus here isn't so much on the finished plan as helping the questioner come up with the right questions and what techniques to look into.  I figure this naturally spins off into questions for the site, results in interesting content for the blog, and naturally draws curious DIYers into the community." />

You can submit a blog entry to the above email, and include your DIY.SE username. If this information is included in the email, your DIY.SE flair will be added to the end of the post so everybody will know how awesome you are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Join the team&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you'd like to become a full team member, shoot us an email including the user name and email address you'd like to use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once we recievce your request to join the team, one of the members will send you an invitation to [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com/). Once you recieve these invitations, simply follow the instructions and login for the first time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**So I'm a member of the team, now what?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well... Now you start writing.  [Login to WordPress](https://en.wordpress.com/wp-login.php), create a new post, and start writing. Remember you can save the draft at any time, so you can write the post all at once, or save it and come back to it later.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We try to post at least one entry a week (Tuesday), So if we have a large volume of posts you may have to wait a bit to see your name in lights.  Unfortunatly it is a **Community** blog, so we have to take turns posting entries. If we get to a point where we have loads of posts coming in, we'll increase the rate at which we publish posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Yeah, but why did I join Trello?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We use Trello as a way to keep track of new ideas, who is working on what, and how far along each entry is.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you have an idea for a post, simply create a new card in the &quot;Post Ideas&quot; list.  You can then assign yourself to the card (by dragging your icon onto the card), or you can leave it unassigned and allow another team member to write the post.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you start to actually write the post, you should move the card to the &quot;Being Written&quot; list. This will show the other members that you are working on the post, and we should expect a new post soon.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are all finished writing a post, move the card to &quot;Ready for Review&quot;.  Once a post reaches this stage, other team members will review your post. They may make simple changes (grammer, spelling, etc.) without any further interaction with you. However, if major changes are needed, the reviewing member may contact you via email or chat to discuss suggested edits with you.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the post has been reviewed, it will be moved to the &quot;Ready to Publish&quot; queue and be assigned a publish date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ever have any questions/comments/concerns, you can always contact the blog team members in the [DIY Blog Contributors chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1481/diy-blog-contributors).&#xD;&#xA;" />

I don't know if it would help the site or not but maybe it's worth a shot." />

In my most perfect 7 years of Alabama education (my worst 3 years being the 5th grade) I have articulated some verbage over the last 3 hours.  I'm still getting over sinus surgery and as long as I have pain pills I have full uses of what little brain I have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On all seriousness, I think communication would help.  I probably could have gotten this out of my brain a little quicker if there was something posted on the DIY Blog chat room or some email sent up as a flare.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason I didn't do it earlier was I didn't pay attention to Trello and this will be my 4th of the year and thought somebody else would contribute.  I'll try to get 1 a month until others get posting.  I just hope what I give is what the site is looking for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing is I just signed on DIY and did an ALT-F search for blog.  There were 3 (not counting the captain) and none of them lead to our blog.  If we made the blog available on the main page then we might get more people reading it and thinking 'I can do that too!'.  Also when I clicked on the questions link only 1 blog link came up and that was to the stack exchange blog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No links for our Google+ or Facebook on main page either.  No follow us on...&#xD;&#xA;We do have the links to post questions I guess onto our personal(?) Facebook or Google+ pages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So my answer to your questions is;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Make the blog accessible from the main page and sub pages.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Add links to our Facebook and Google+ to main page and sub pages.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Add good posts (Q &amp; A's) to Facebook and Google+ more often.  Maybe picking questions and or answers with 10 or more votes.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Add something at the end post asking &quot;If you have a DIY experience and would like to share it click here.&quot;&#xD;&#xA; 5. It would be nice to see a blog about some DIY Easter stories if any are around ;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As always, let me know when I can help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please make sure my article is reviewed before you put it out.  I am terrible at proof reading my own stuff.  If I'm posting wrong let me know what to do and I will do it right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Edit April 10, 2012**&#xD;&#xA;Is there actually a lead person on this or is it more just a community working together?" />

As such, we ask that you please follow the steps below when creating posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Come up with a good idea for a blog post.&#xD;&#xA;This is often times the most difficult and time consuming part of the process. Remember entries do not have to be long epic novels, short descriptions of projects you've completed (with pictures of course) can be even more awesome. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Create a Card in Trello.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Log in to Trello (you should have already been invited to the Trello, if not please ask for an invite on the [DIY Blog Contributors chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1481/diy-blog-contributors)).&#xD;&#xA; - Click ***Add Card***, on the ***Post Ideas*** list.&#xD;&#xA; - Add a description for the post (this does not have to be the final title of the post), than click ***Add***.&#xD;&#xA; - Drag your user icon onto the card (This allows other users to see who will be working on this post).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Start writing the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Log in to Trello, and drag the card for this post from ***Post Ideas*** to ***Being Written*** (this lets other users know a post is on the way).&#xD;&#xA; - Log in to Word Press and click ***Add New*** -&gt; ***Post***.&#xD;&#xA; - Write the post.  &#xD;&#xA; - You can save your progress any time by clicking ***Save Draft*** (please **DO NOT** click ***Publish***).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Get your post reviewed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have finished writing your post, you can submit it to be reviewed by other members of the community (this is currently optional, but encouraged).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - In Word Press, assign the ***Ready for Review*** category to the post.&#xD;&#xA; - In Trello, drag the card from ***Being Written*** to ***Ready for Review***.&#xD;&#xA; - Open the **Card Menu** and choose ***Assign Members***.&#xD;&#xA; - Click your icon to remove yourself from the card.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Ready to publish... almost&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once a post has been reviewed, the reviewer will move the Trello card to the ***Ready to Publish*** list and assign the ***Ready to Publish*** category to the post in Word Press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once a date is selected for this post to be published, a **Due Date** will be assigned to the card in Trello.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the selected day the post will be published, and will be available for public consumption at http://diy.blogoverflow.com/.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, Thank you for participating in the DIY StackExchange blog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###NOTES:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Remember this is a community blog, and posts are published on a schedule. We have to take turns publishing posts, so please **DO NOT** publish posts yourself.  All posts will be published for you, by an administrator, on the appropriate date&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - To ensure we always have fresh posts, we are currently on a 1-a-week schedule.  This means that your posts will likely have to wait to be published, we understand that this can be frustrating.  We will do our best to make sure posts are published as quickly as possible.  As more contributors join in we should be able to increase the publish rate, so posts will be published sooner.  Until that time, we thank you for your patience and understanding." />

Once you recieve these invitations, simply follow the instructions and login for the first time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**So I'm a member of the team, now what?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well... Now you start writing.  [Login to WordPress](https://en.wordpress.com/wp-login.php), create a new post, and start writing. Remember you can save the draft at any time, so you can write the post all at once, or save it and come back to it later.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We try to post at least one entry a week (Tuesday), So if we have a large volume of posts you may have to wait a bit to see your name in lights.  Unfortunatly it is a **Community** blog, so we have to take turns posting entries. If we get to a point where we have loads of posts coming in, we'll increase the rate at which we publish posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Yeah, but why did I join Trello?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We use Trello as a way to keep track of new ideas, who is working on what, and how far along each entry is.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you have an idea for a post, simply create a new card in the &quot;Post Ideas&quot; list.  You can then assign yourself to the card (by dragging your icon onto the card), or you can leave it unassigned and allow another team member to write the post.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you start to actually write the post, you should move the card to the &quot;Being Written&quot; list. This will show the other members that you are working on the post, and we should expect a new post soon.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are all finished writing a post, move the card to &quot;Ready for Review&quot;.  Once a post reaches this stage, other team members will review your post. They may make simple changes (grammer, spelling, etc.) without any further interaction with you. However, if major changes are needed, the reviewing member may contact you via email or chat to discuss suggested edits with you.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the post has been reviewed, it will be moved to the &quot;Ready to Publish&quot; queue and be assigned a publish date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ever have any questions/comments/concerns, you can always contact the blog team members in the [DIY Blog Contributors chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1481/diy-blog-contributors).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information on publishing articles, please read this [Answer](http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/a/548/33)&#xD;&#xA;" />

Subjects that are popular on Pinterest and have a corresponding SE site are: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Photography&#xD;&#xA; - DIY/Home Improvement&#xD;&#xA; - Gardening &amp; Landscaping&#xD;&#xA; - Food (corresponds to Seasoned Advice)&#xD;&#xA; - Fitness &amp; Nutrition (less popular on Pinterest than the other topics)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of trying out a Stack Exchange Pinterest account is to meet potential new users in a place where they are already congregating. Pinterest has had explosive growth in the past six months, and its primary demographic is different enough from most Stack Exchange sites' current demographics for it to be worth a shot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each of the above topics would be its own board on the Stack Exchange Pinterest account. Content (&quot;pins&quot;) would include content from our own sites as well as interesting content from elsewhere around the Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My question for you all is this:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you in favor of, or against, having your Stack Exchange content pinned on Pinterest? My plan is to write user names in the pin description for any content that comes from this site, but Pinterest does not require attribution for content that is re-pinned (meaning that my attribution to the OP might be lost if other people repost that content).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everything that I would post to Pinterest would link back to the original source, and include some sort of author/photographer attribution in the description. The original source would be the actual Q&amp;A page for any questions or answers shared, and the permanent Blog Overflow URL for any images shared from blog posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pinterest is still figuring out how to make their Terms of Service work for them as a business without infringing on/changing licensing or rights to other people's content, and there is a huge range in attitudes about the value of Pinterest. Therefore, I'd love to hear any and all thoughts you guys have on the matter before I get started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://pinterest.com/" />

If you're on Pinterest (or if you're just curious what this is all about), check it out: http://pinterest.com/stackexchange/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Pinterest][1] is an online bulletin board of sorts - users pin images, write notes about what they love, and organize them into different &quot;boards.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am putting together a plan for a Stack Exchange Pinterest account, with the idea being that Stack Exchange as a brand can start participating in the broader conversations about topics we have sites for. Subjects that are popular on Pinterest and have a corresponding SE site are: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Photography&#xD;&#xA; - DIY/Home Improvement&#xD;&#xA; - Gardening &amp; Landscaping&#xD;&#xA; - Food (corresponds to Seasoned Advice)&#xD;&#xA; - Fitness &amp; Nutrition (less popular on Pinterest than the other topics)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of trying out a Stack Exchange Pinterest account is to meet potential new users in a place where they are already congregating. Pinterest has had explosive growth in the past six months, and its primary demographic is different enough from most Stack Exchange sites' current demographics for it to be worth a shot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each of the above topics would be its own board on the Stack Exchange Pinterest account.

My plan is to write user names in the pin description for any content that comes from this site, but Pinterest does not require attribution for content that is re-pinned (meaning that my attribution to the OP might be lost if other people repost that content).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everything that I would post to Pinterest would link back to the original source, and include some sort of author/photographer attribution in the description. The original source would be the actual Q&amp;A page for any questions or answers shared, and the permanent Blog Overflow URL for any images shared from blog posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pinterest is still figuring out how to make their Terms of Service work for them as a business without infringing on/changing licensing or rights to other people's content, and there is a huge range in attitudes about the value of Pinterest. Therefore, I'd love to hear any and all thoughts you guys have on the matter before I get started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://pinterest.com/" />

While it may initially sound like a good idea to make everything a question, it's ultimately misguided and counterproductive. Forcing titles to be questions forces the inclusion of boilerplate text. We want to avoid boilerplate for the same reasons that the word [&quot;question&quot; isn't allowed in titles](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/114224/151987) and [&quot;For issues relating to&quot; isn't allowed in wiki excerpts](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/116754/151987). The title is essentially the elevator pitch for the question. When skimming titles, **especially** in the &quot;Linked&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; sidebars, people want to easily tell what differentiates those questions so they know whether it really is related to their own problem. If they all start with &quot;How can I&quot;, &quot;How should I&quot;, &quot;How do I&quot;, then that makes it *harder* to tell them apart, not easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question's title needs to be detailed, but succinct. Consider the titles of news articles or research papers. They need to convey the main thrust while fitting in a limited space. I wouldn't go so far as to change all titles that are questions to not be questions, but the added boiler plate is a hindrance to the goal of the title: to distinguish one question from others on similar subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To borrow from [my answer in The Great Debate](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/99197/151987):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What we *really* want is for the title to be the well-described *subject*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (in the grammatical sense) of that question which starts with &quot;I need help to ...&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the example given, without more detail, I'd call it &quot;Painting a ceiling&quot;.

While it may initially sound like a good idea to make everything a question, it's ultimately misguided and counterproductive. Forcing titles to be questions forces the inclusion of boilerplate text. We want to avoid boilerplate for the same reasons that the word [&quot;question&quot; isn't allowed in titles](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/114224/151987) and [&quot;For issues relating to&quot; isn't allowed in wiki excerpts](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/116754/151987), and why [salutations are stripped](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/93989/151987). The title is essentially the elevator pitch for the question. When skimming titles, **especially** in the &quot;Linked&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; sidebars, people want to easily tell what differentiates those questions so they know whether it really is related to their own problem. If they all start with &quot;How can I&quot;, &quot;How should I&quot;, &quot;How do I&quot;, then that makes it *harder* to tell them apart, not easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles should be&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question's title needs to be detailed, but succinct. Consider the titles of news articles or research papers. They need to convey the main thrust while fitting in a limited space. I wouldn't go so far as to change all titles that are questions to not be questions, but the added boiler plate is a hindrance to the goal of the title: to distinguish one question from others on similar subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To borrow from [my answer in The Great Debate](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/99197/151987):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What we *really* want is for the title to be the well-described *subject*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (in the grammatical sense) of that question which starts with &quot;I need help to ...&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the example given, without more detail, I'd call it &quot;Painting a ceiling&quot;. Though I'd much prefer something like &quot;Applying oil-based paint to a textured drywall ceiling&quot;. Any words that *can* be omitted from the title without obscuring what the question is about, *should* be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Affects on searching&#xD;&#xA;--------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding search optimization, if all questions start with some variation of &quot;how do I&quot; then those words become useless as search keywords. Other Stack Exchange sites have already run into this problem and [requested that these words be ignored by the site search](http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/questions/289/include-how-do-i-you-we-in-the-list-of-stop-words-for-search). Google will also have figured this out, as they do everything they can to ensure that pages' ranks are determined by their usefulness rather than SEO games.

It includes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Keep it short&#xD;&#xA; - Lead with the most important words&#xD;&#xA; - Don't start with &quot;How do I&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles shouldn't be&#xD;&#xA;------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would go with &quot;neither&quot;. While it may initially sound like a good idea to make everything a question, it's ultimately misguided and counterproductive. Forcing titles to be questions forces the inclusion of boilerplate text. We want to avoid boilerplate for the same reasons that the word [&quot;question&quot; isn't allowed in titles](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/114224/151987) and [&quot;For issues relating to&quot; isn't allowed in wiki excerpts](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/116754/151987), and why [salutations are stripped](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/93989/151987). The title is essentially the elevator pitch for the question. When skimming titles, **especially** in the &quot;Linked&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; sidebars, people want to easily tell what differentiates those questions so they know whether it really is related to their own problem. If they all start with &quot;How can I&quot;, &quot;How should I&quot;, &quot;How do I&quot;, then that makes it *harder* to tell them apart, not easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles should be&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question's title needs to be detailed, but succinct. Consider the titles of news articles or research papers. They need to convey the main thrust while fitting in a limited space. I wouldn't go so far as to change all titles that are questions to not be questions, but the added boiler plate is a hindrance to the goal of the title: to distinguish one question from others on similar subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To borrow from [my answer in The Great Debate](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/99197/151987):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What we *really* want is for the title to be the well-described *subject*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (in the grammatical sense) of that question which starts with &quot;I need help to ...&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the example given, without more detail, I'd call it &quot;Painting a ceiling&quot;. Though I'd much prefer something like &quot;Applying oil-based paint to a textured drywall ceiling&quot;. Any words that *can* be omitted from the title without obscuring what the question is about, *should* be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Affects on searching&#xD;&#xA;--------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding search optimization, if all questions start with some variation of &quot;how do I&quot; then those words become useless as search keywords. Other Stack Exchange sites have already run into this problem and [requested that these words be ignored by the site search](http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/questions/289/include-how-do-i-you-we-in-the-list-of-stop-words-for-search). Google will also have figured this out, as they do everything they can to ensure that pages' ranks are determined by their usefulness rather than SEO games. Also, [as Jeff Atwood points out](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/99195/151987): &quot;Google only supports a fixed # of words in the title of a page?

Once you recieve these invitations, simply follow the instructions and login for the first time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**So I'm a member of the team, now what?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well... Now you start writing.  [Login to WordPress](http://diy.blogoverflow.com/wp-admin/), create a new post, and start writing. Remember you can save the draft at any time, so you can write the post all at once, or save it and come back to it later.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We try to post at least one entry a week (Tuesday), So if we have a large volume of posts you may have to wait a bit to see your name in lights.  Unfortunatly it is a **Community** blog, so we have to take turns posting entries. If we get to a point where we have loads of posts coming in, we'll increase the rate at which we publish posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Yeah, but why did I join Trello?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We use Trello as a way to keep track of new ideas, who is working on what, and how far along each entry is.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you have an idea for a post, simply create a new card in the &quot;Post Ideas&quot; list.  You can then assign yourself to the card (by dragging your icon onto the card), or you can leave it unassigned and allow another team member to write the post.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you start to actually write the post, you should move the card to the &quot;Being Written&quot; list. This will show the other members that you are working on the post, and we should expect a new post soon.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are all finished writing a post, move the card to &quot;Ready for Review&quot;.  Once a post reaches this stage, other team members will review your post. They may make simple changes (grammer, spelling, etc.) without any further interaction with you. However, if major changes are needed, the reviewing member may contact you via email or chat to discuss suggested edits with you.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the post has been reviewed, it will be moved to the &quot;Ready to Publish&quot; queue and be assigned a publish date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ever have any questions/comments/concerns, you can always contact the blog team members in the [DIY Blog Contributors chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1481/diy-blog-contributors).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information on publishing articles, please read this [Answer](http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/a/548/33)&#xD;&#xA;" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - useful tools or resources for home improvement&#xD;&#xA; - interesting in-site activities and events&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Personally, I tend to watch Mike Holmes and This Old House, but I don't participate in the local hacker space, these are two distinct communities to me. In the past, there have been attempts to create sites around personal electronics that failed because they became very broad with too few people that could answer the questions. The lesson there is that we don't want a site that's so broad that anyone can ask a question, but no one is around to answer it. The model adopted by SE is sites that have a well defined scope that can attract a core group able the answer the questions.

I can't even think of any other topics that may need this amount of categorization -- but if there is a need I'd suggest we deal with them based on the technical difference, rather than adding a region for the sake of adding a region.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*: *That said, we COULD add a whole tag hierarchy for identifying the region, but getting people to use it will be tough, and it may not even be useful. At least as a separate set of tags, it can apply (or not apply) to any and all topics, and we can be as specific or broad as needed without having to affect `electrical-*`, `plumbing-*` etc tags.*" />

I love the opinions because the allow me to make a more informed decision.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the diy-pro tag and I like the questions.

I'd like to suggest that we ask the SE team to ask the user to state their location on the Ask A Question page itself. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As many people have figured out, it's [incredibly important to state your location and give information about your climate][3], especially when you're considering changing the building envelope. The advice that I'd give regarding building envelope, insulation, penetrations of the envelope, and attic ventilation as a 2A/Hot-Humid Texan is completely different than the advice that's correct for someone living in British Columbia or even the US upper Midwest. As an example, in the US upper Midwest you would put insulation, and then a vapor barrier against the drywall. In the US deep South, putting up a vapor barrier like that would cause your drywall to rot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example is that Maryland and Illinois have adopted the 2012 IECC, but all other US states are still on the 2009 code. Obviously, answers for people who are in Illinois or Maryland are going to be different. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question askers don't necessarily know that the answer is going to depend on their region, so they don't think to state it. This has caused a lot of repeat questions, [but unlike most people][2], I don't think that's a bad thing as long as the question is edited to make the location obvious.

Luckily, &quot;crinkle paint&quot; came up in google search. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other times, I'm not so lucky. I may need a metal that's easy to drill into, but won't dent if it's dropped. Lately, I've been sorting through plastics, and getting lost in the alphabet soup--with little to know information about which plastics will shatter like acrylic if you drill it the wrong way vs. which are very tolerant to machining and fabrication. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes, I'm working on a sculpture, and just want to find out about some new and interesting materials that I may not know about, or find out the pitfalls of using a common material in an unconvnetional way. For instance, I once filled a mold with a liquid-nails ripoff, but when I tried fabricating the object a few weeks later, I found the center to still be viscous instead of hardened. I would have liked a place to ask how long an 8&quot; cube of Liquid Nails takes to cure fully all the way to the center. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this an appropriate forum to ask &quot;What kind of metal/plastic/wood/wood-substitute will allow me to do A without B happening?&quot; even if it's not ~specifically~ home improvement related?

Your question is too broad, because you are asking us to solve a complex problem with no guidelines whatsoever. You're asking us to design a potentially patentable product for you. As far as this question being detrimental to the site... possibly. Folks tend to use similar questions as precedent, when arguing that their question is on topic (as you have done). So leaving questions like this open can indeed be detrimental to the site. – Tester101♦ [Sep 9 at 12:23](http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/31446/motorizing-sliding-windows#comment44478_31446)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That comment gets to the point of why I feel this question is off topic.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the OP would have asked something along the lines of... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;*I'm working on building a mechanical means to actuate a sliding window, but I'm having trouble with this specific bit.  How can I attach the foo to the bar, without breaking the baz?*&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question would probably have been on topic, as the question is asking how to solve a specific problem.  A question like that can be answered in a paragraph or two, and has a limited number of solutions.  Asking the community to design a complex; potentially patentable, product, could lead to thousands of &quot;correct&quot; answers. The OP would then use some criteria (which is only known to them), to select the &quot;right&quot; answer.  In the game of StackExchange, this is an unfair question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This site is a game. You score points by asking good questions, and providing good answers. You get a bonus if your answer is correct. When you ask a question, you're setting the rules for that round of the game. When you ask questions with this in mind &quot;*so that I could select the design most likely to work in this situation.*&quot;, you're asking people to play a game where the rules can constantly change. They call this game &quot;*I win*&quot;, and only the winner likes to play that type of game. – Tester101♦ [Aug 28 at 16:02](http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/31165/how-can-i-transmogrify-a-fixed-monitor-post-in-to-a-variable-height-monitor-post#comment43777_31165)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When asking a *good* question, you should not only include the *rules* but also the winning criteria.

Removing details and rephrasing things to avoid asking your actual question are the exact opposite purposes of the edit link, and so I typically ignore those requests. Very rarely do I reopen a &quot;shop for me&quot; question after it's been edited, since unlike ambiguous questions where added detail can save a question, or overly localized questions where they can be rephrased to apply to a greater audience, shopping questions can't be edited to be a better shopping question that would then be on topic." />

I'm active much less of that time, but respond to notifications of new content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **2)** Do you have experience moderating, either on other StackExchange sites or on other online communities? If so, what has that experience taught you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've managed several mailing lists back in the day, as well as a couple Facebook groups.  Obviously the Facebook experience has taught me that there are a lot of morons in the world.  But for some reason they tend to avoid StackExchange sites.    What I've learned is that the admin team gains its authority from the community.  Once you have the community berating the mods, you have a problem. You have to be a non-judgmental, impartial passive voice of reason and never rise to bait or trolls.   This is never about me. It's about the site and its users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **3)** How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This user could be harming the site, creating busy-work for moderators, or both.   In the second case, I'd just suck it up.  It's my job.  A couple of gentle prods with the email-hammer might help.  But there are always going to be some users who will cause issues, but are generally a positive addition to the community.  We don't pull out the ban-hammer just because they cause administrative problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Arguments and flags have to be dealt with on a case by case issue.  Argument over the content of an answer should be allowed to some degree -- it's how we distill the truth.  Let it go on for a short time, and then clean up the thread.  Insults, or offensive remarks need to be removed immediately.  The user needs to be warned, and if this behaviour is persistent, given a time out.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **4)** How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Talk to the mod. Discuss it in chat.  @Bmitch and @Tester101 both frequently raise issues in chat quite frequently.  Mods from other sites hang out there as well and tend to offer advice.   This is a great resource.  The one thing I would lose is the vote to reopen option.  It reopens a question on a single moderator vote.  I will not get into a peeing match with another mod.  Consensus will be achieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **5)** How would you balance the often conflicting roles of maintaining a welcoming site to new users while avoiding questions that are off topic?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Gentle guidance.  I will actively communicate with new users, helping them form good questions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **6)** What is the purpose of down votes and how would you promote that purpose?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this site, a down vote on an answer is to show that you feel the answer is incorrect or inadvisable.  In my opinion, every down vote should require a comment.   On this site, a wrong answer could potentially kill someone.  So the answer suggesting you test an outlet by sticking a paperclip in it must be down-voted and comments need to explicitly state that this is a BLOODY STUPID thing to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions are a bit different.  A question &quot;Why doesn't my xxx work?&quot; is a bad question because it is unanswerable without further information.  It should be down-voted, and a comment added to this effect.  This has the effect of notifying the user and hopefully encouraging an edit to improve the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **7)** Are there things with the current site you wish to change (e.g. the site scope, moderation policies) and if so, how would you make that change happen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not entirely sure that all &quot;Shop for me&quot; questions are off topic.  see http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/questions/607/can-we-discourage-shop-for-me-type-questions for my opinion on this issue.  We're still feeling out our scope, and I'd like to see it happen organically, via the users rather than from the moderators.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **8)** Close votes and some flags cast by a moderator are binding, resulting in immediate action taken without further agreement needed by the community. Will this change alter how you use the site, and if so, how?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Excellent question.  It will definitely change how I do my morning reviews.  In the close queue, I tend to adjudicate on a &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; If I generally don't feel a particular question is beneficial to the site, I'll vote to close.  But, with the modhammer, I'll need to be much more certain that a question is off-topic according to the rules.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **9)** In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm very close to 10k, and will probably achieve that threshold in a month or so.  The answer is AUTHORITY.  Comments and suggestions from moderators are taken much more seriously by the users than from another &quot;ordinary&quot; user, regardless of rep.  That blue diamond beside your name suggests that you are speaking for, and from the authority of the community as a whole.  See questions 3 and 5 for how I would use this authority.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **10)** Please weigh in on the great screw debate, Torx, Robertson, Phillips, or some other screw?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There was a joke in chat that whenever someone mentioned &quot;Robertson Screws&quot; I'd show up.  If Torx were as ubiquitous and cheap as Robertsons, then I'd go with Torx.  But they aren't.  And Phillips are just painful to use under most circumstances.  Robertsons stick well to the end of the driver, and don't torque out like Phillips do.   " />

I look in on my SE sites several times during the day, and typically have a chat window open so I'd hear any pings from there if I'm near a PC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of the moderation issues I see here can be handled quickly (spam, non-answers, etc.) and I already spend a lot of time on SE sites, so I could easily divert some to things that require more attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **2)** Do you have experience moderating, either on other StackExchange sites or on other online communities? If so, what has that experience taught you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've been more engaged with Stack Exchange than anything else on the internet, so I don't have much moderation experience elsewhere. I've been moderating on [Gardening &amp; Landscaping][1] since February 2013. In that time, I've learned that sometimes, no matter how much you try to help them, people don't want to be helped. I'm **learning** that you can't let yourself get upset about that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **3)** How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyone can have a bad day, but if someone has a pattern of abusive behavior over time, then regardless of their contributions, they need to be calmed down. They don't have the right to ruin the site for everyone else. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd start by cleaning up the comments or chat messages where the argument is occurring: sometimes, all that's needed to calm things down is knowing that a &quot;grown-up&quot; is watching. Next up is pulling them into a private chat room and asking them to desist. If that doesn't work, I'd escalate with mod messages and timed suspensions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **4)** How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Discuss it with them; depending on the context and content, either via the moderator-only channels or in the public chat room. Questions can often be interpreted different ways, so if there's something wrong with the question that I don't see, I'd like to know so I can learn and do better next time a similar situation comes up. Likewise, knowing that the question is ambiguous means that we could leave comments asking the OP to improve it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **5)** How would you balance the often conflicting roles of maintaining a welcoming site to new users while avoiding questions that are off topic?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do a lot of this on [Gardening &amp; Landscaping][1]: close a question or delete a follow-on post that's not an answer and leave a comment welcoming them to the site, explaining what they did wrong, and pointing them to the appropriate meta, /about or /help page for more information. My hope is to have them come back and become useful members of the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **6)** What is the purpose of down votes and how would you promote that purpose?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On questions, I generally down vote when it's obvious nonsense (&quot;How do I build a bear pit in my backyard?&quot;) or the OP ignores our conventions (&quot;I know this is off-topic, but here goes anyway...&quot;). We get a lot of new users that are well-meaning but don't know how to ask a good question; I don't like to downvote these when commenting and editing in details can improve the question enough to make it useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll downvote an answer if I know it's wrong, or if it's completely at odds with the question (&quot;You asked about X, let me tell you about Y&quot;). New users asking follow-on questions, forum-style, I generally just flag and leave alone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **7)** Are there things with the current site you wish to change (e.g. the site scope, moderation policies) and if so, how would you make that change happen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm fairly happy with the site's scope, though it would be great if we could solve the perennial shopping question for once and for all. If we were to expand the scope, I'd like to include more woodworking: over time, my interests have expanded beyond nailing 2x4's together prior to attaching drywall, and towards making things that I'd actually want to see in my house.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the current moderation team are doing a good job, and they've coped well with the occasional bit of insanity on the site. The things I'd do differently are minor, like leaving more explanatory comments on deleted posts, and adding the &quot;insufficient explanation&quot; notice where appropriate on one-liner answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **8)** Close votes and some flags cast by a moderator are binding, resulting in immediate action taken without further agreement needed by the community. Will this change alter how you use the site, and if so, how?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some things, no. We get some spam, offensive posts and obvious nonsense that I'd close and/or delete without hesitation, exactly the way I'd flag it now (and maybe call attention to it in the chat room if people are in there).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other cases, I'd let the community weigh in before I make a move. As a 3k rep user, I can cast the first close vote knowing that I need the agreement of other users for it to take effect. As a moderator, I'd have to wait for the post to gather some close votes before casting the deciding one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **9)** In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I occasionally see a post late at night that deserves immediate deletion. It would be great to be able to do that instead of leaving it on the site for moderators to take care of some number of hours later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We often get posts from new users that promote a product, and it can sometimes be hard to distinguish the well-meant advice from the spam. If I had suspicions about a post's legitimacy, I'd be able to do some digging to find out if there's any connection between the poster and the product. I don't generally flag this because I don't want to bother the moderators on a hunch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **10)** Please weigh in on the great screw debate, Torx, Robertson, Phillips, or some other screw?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Phillips head if it's in a drywall screw and I'm using a drywall bit. I can't recall ever using a Torx screw in a home improvement project, only on electronics. I've used Robertson trim screws for some woodwork and been very happy with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gardening.stackexchange.com" />

I also regularly check the site on evenings and weekends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    2) Do you have experience moderating, either on other StackExchange sites or on other online communities? If so, what has that experience taught you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have been moderating online communities in one form or another since 1984 when I ran a bulletin board on an Atari 120SE out of my bedroom.  I participated in FidoNET in the late 80's.  I managed eq.stratics.com forum and website for 2 years in 99-2000 after participating as a moderator for a few years prior.  I created PilotsOfAmerica.com and set up a moderator community which I then participated in as an equal member, ultimately transferring titular ownership to the management council when I stepped down a few years later.  I currently serve as a moderator on FrugalVillage forums.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators in my view have the job of protecting the community from outside attackers while keeping the peace within the community.  That means dealing swiftly and decisively with those who seek only to cause harm, while being patient, understanding yet firm with those who truly wish to be a part of the community but need a little help adjusting to the rules of that community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    3) How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm a big believer in giving someone enough rope to let them hang themselves.  I would first communicate privately with them over email and explain the issue and ask them to exercise a bit more discretion in their comments.  If that failed, after 2 or 3 attempts, there would be little choice but to ban them.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    4) How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Discuss it with the moderator in question.  I would never independently overrule another moderator, but if there were a consensus among several mods that felt the item should be reopened then I would reopen it.  It would have to be at least a 2/3 majority in favor of reopening (based on available mods to poll at the time).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    5) How would you balance the often conflicting roles of maintaining a welcoming site to new users while avoiding questions that are off topic?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Migration where other SE sites existed.  Otherwise if salvageable, encourage the user to refine their question to be more on topic.  However, I find the community usually does a good job of catching these without moderators sweeping in to take over.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    6) What is the purpose of down votes and how would you promote that purpose?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They should be used to reflect a poor quality question or answer, not for a personal agenda.  I personally like to post reasons for downvotes when I downvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    7) Are there things with the current site you wish to change (e.g. the site scope, moderation policies) and if so, how would you make that change happen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Frankly, no.  I'm generally pleased with how the site runs now.  That's why I'm volunteering to assist - to help preserve the existing practices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    8) Close votes and some flags cast by a moderator are binding, resulting in immediate action taken without further agreement needed by the community. Will this change alter how you use the site, and if so, how?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only in cases where the questions/answers are clearly meant to be disruptive as opposed to simply off topic.  I like that community votes are used to determine when closures are appropriate and don't wish to disrupt that process.  I suppose if that means my votes to close would be binding immediately then I'd use it much less often than I do now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    9) In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mainly in the ability to more directly defend the integrity of the site.  When troublesome users appear, that's when mod tools are needed.  Otherwise, the existing community balance does a great job.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    10) Please weigh in on the great screw debate, Torx, Robertson, Phillips, or some other screw?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm a big fan of screws in general, and I don't discriminate based on brand, style or thread-count." />

Fighting / arguments are unacceptable in my opinion and I would ban the user once I've received consensus amongst the other moderators.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4) How would you handle a situation where another mod&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would speak (chat) with the moderator and try to learn from his / her experience and understand why something was closed. If I felt the moderator was in the wrong still, I would speak to others about the situation and see if we could work towards a solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5) How would you balance the often conflicting roles of maintaining a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; welcoming site to new users while avoiding questions that are off&#xD;&#xA;&gt; topic?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would direct them to the chat room.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 6) What is the purpose of down votes and how would you promote that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; purpose?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Down votes are used to identify poor answers. If someone asked me what a down vote means, I'd explain the community is only as valuable is it's information content. If poor answers weren't identified, in the case of DIY, someone could get hurt or killed. On DIY, identifying bad answers could prevent property damage or personal injury.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 7) Are there things with the current site you wish to change (e.g. the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; site scope, moderation policies) and if so, how would you make that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; change happen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have no gripes right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 8) Close votes and some flags cast by a moderator are binding,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; resulting in immediate action taken without further agreement needed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by the community.

Voting to close a question; even by a moderator, puts the question into this new &quot;On Hold&quot; status.  At this point, comments should be left suggesting ways to modify the question to make it acceptable.  By doing this, we give the user a second chance.  If they take it, the question can be edited and reopened. If they don't, the question eventually moves to the &quot;Closed&quot; status.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I guess what I'm asking is...  Should we be voting to close more often?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - useful tools or resources for home improvement&#xD;&#xA; - interesting in-site activities and events&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **220 x 250 pixels**&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/ads/display/913" />

The person who creates an image (or a piece of text or music) owns that *work* and has the right to decide how and when it is used, including where and when it can be copied and distributed. There are numerous factors must be considered to figure out whether copying and posting of an image is permitted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Public Domain&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;If something is in the public domain, anyone can use it freely. **HOWEVER** very few images on the internet are in the public domain. Usually they are limited to images:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - created before the early 1920s,&#xD;&#xA; - created by or for US government agencies, or&#xD;&#xA; - that the owner (usually the photographer, the artist or their employer) has explicitly dedicated to the public domain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is practically *none* of the images that appear on the internet. Unless something explicitly *says* it is in the public domain, you have to assume it is not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the placement of images on the web **DOES NOT** place them in the public domain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Self Created Images&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;If the poster made it, she owns it (unless she did it in connection with her employment).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Licensed Use&#xD;&#xA;------------&#xD;&#xA;If the owner of an image gives you permission to use it, it is *licensed* and you can use it in the manner and to the extent that the owner has explicitly allowed. But only in that manner and to that extent. Any other use is a copyright violation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you find an image, check the site (e.g., the LEGAL section) to see if there is a license, and what it allows.  If there is no indication, that means **IT IS NOT LICENSED**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some specialized licenses, such as Creative Commons, that allow extensive use, but have certain requirements about how a work is distributed and what notices are required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fair Use&#xD;&#xA;--------&#xD;&#xA;This is the hard one. The use of some copyrighted materials may be allowed without the owner's permission if it meets the criteria of the *Fair Use Doctrine*. This allows certain uses that are not likely to diminish the interests of the owners of the copyright.  For example, certain specific educational uses are allowed. Other uses *may* be allowed if they are not likely to compromise the intent and commercial interests of the owner. There are four factors that are generally considered and weighed to determine if a particular use meets the *fair use* criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes&#xD;&#xA; 2. The nature of the copyrighted work&#xD;&#xA; 3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole&#xD;&#xA; 4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these factors are not simple *yes/no* questions. There is often no bright line to indicate whether a use would be permitted. A fuller discussion of *fair use* can be found at the Copyright Office website **[here][1]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Viewpoint&#xD;&#xA;-------&#xD;&#xA;*[What follows is merely an viewpoint, and not a description of the policy of this site, or a statement about the law or the reaction that an owner of an image may hold.]*  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One approach that *may* meet the fair use criteria is the inclusion of images from commercial sites if you also include links to those sites.  For example, if a manufacturer or distributor shows a product image on its site, they are likely to either own or have permission to use that image, and are not likely to object to you copying that image **if** you link back to their site. This forum does not encourage promotion of any commercial product or site, but such a link, for illustrative purposes only, would probably not raise the ire of this forum or the linked company. It would also be a good idea to insert a notation that makes clear that the link in not an endorsement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lifting images from sites that rely on images to promote their own interests is unlikely to meet the fair use test. Lifting copies of images that the owner seeks to sell (e.g., stock photos, plans to be download for a fee) is definitely not allowed. Use of images from sites that offer information similar to this site (competitors) is likely to bring the *Wrath of Khan* (or the *Revenge of the Lannisters*, depending on your own pop-cultural star) down upon you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Summary&#xD;&#xA;-------&#xD;&#xA;Your own stuff is the best. Your friends' stuff they said you could use, next best. Everything else, take care and think about the factors laid out in the fair use doctrine. Often, if an unauthorized use is objected to by an owner, removal of the offending image may be enough to resolve the problem. But tread cautiously.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" />

Contact one of the moderators in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/111/home-improvement), and let them know you'd like to contribute.  A moderator will then change your WordPress permissions, and you'll be all set to go.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**So I'm a member of the team, now what?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well... Now you start writing.  [Login to WordPress](http://diy.blogoverflow.com/wp-admin/), create a new post, and start writing. Remember you can save the draft at any time, so you can write the post all at once, or save it and come back to it later.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We try to post at least one entry a week (Tuesday), So if we have a large volume of posts you may have to wait a bit to see your name in lights.  Unfortunately it is a **Community** blog, so we have to take turns posting entries. If we get to a point where we have loads of posts coming in, we'll increase the rate at which we publish posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;strike&gt;**Yeah, but why did I join Trello?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We use Trello as a way to keep track of new ideas, who is working on what, and how far along each entry is.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you have an idea for a post, simply create a new card in the &quot;Post Ideas&quot; list.  You can then assign yourself to the card (by dragging your icon onto the card), or you can leave it unassigned and allow another team member to write the post.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you start to actually write the post, you should move the card to the &quot;Being Written&quot; list. This will show the other members that you are working on the post, and we should expect a new post soon.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are all finished writing a post, move the card to &quot;Ready for Review&quot;.  Once a post reaches this stage, other team members will review your post. They may make simple changes (grammar, spelling, etc.) without any further interaction with you. However, if major changes are needed, the reviewing member may contact you via email or chat to discuss suggested edits with you.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the post has been reviewed, it will be moved to the &quot;Ready to Publish&quot; queue and be assigned a publish date.&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ever have any questions/comments/concerns, you can always contact the blog team members in the [DIY Blog Contributors chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1481/diy-blog-contributors), or [Home Improvement Chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/111/home-improvement) .  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information on publishing articles, please read this [Answer](http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/a/548/33)&#xD;&#xA;" />

This means that your posts will likely have to wait to be published, we understand that this can be frustrating.  We will do our best to make sure posts are published as quickly as possible.  As more contributors join in we should be able to increase the publish rate, so posts will be published sooner.  Until that time, we thank you for your patience and understanding." />

It includes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep it short&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lead with the most important words&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't start with &quot;How do I&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What titles shouldn't be&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would go with &quot;neither&quot;. While it may initially sound like a good idea to make everything a question, it's ultimately misguided and counterproductive. Forcing titles to be questions forces the inclusion of boilerplate text. We want to avoid boilerplate for the same reasons that the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/114224/151987&quot;&gt;&quot;question&quot; isn't allowed in titles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/116754/151987&quot;&gt;&quot;For issues relating to&quot; isn't allowed in wiki excerpts&lt;/a&gt;, and why &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93989/151987&quot;&gt;salutations are stripped&lt;/a&gt;. The title is essentially the elevator pitch for the question. When skimming titles, &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; in the &quot;Linked&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; sidebars, people want to easily tell what differentiates those questions so they know whether it really is related to their own problem. If they all start with &quot;How can I&quot;, &quot;How should I&quot;, &quot;How do I&quot;, then that makes it &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; to tell them apart, not easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What titles should be&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question's title needs to be detailed, but succinct. Consider the titles of news articles or research papers. They need to convey the main thrust while fitting in a limited space. I wouldn't go so far as to change all titles that are questions to not be questions, but the added boiler plate is a hindrance to the goal of the title: to distinguish one question from others on similar subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To borrow from &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99197/151987&quot;&gt;my answer in The Great Debate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want is for the title to be the well-described &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;  (in the grammatical sense) of that question which starts with &quot;I need help to ...&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the example given, without more detail, I'd call it &quot;Painting a ceiling&quot;. Though I'd much prefer something like &quot;Applying oil-based paint to a textured drywall ceiling&quot;. Any words that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be omitted from the title without obscuring what the question is about, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Affects on searching&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding search optimization, if all questions start with some variation of &quot;how do I&quot; then those words become useless as search keywords. Other Stack Exchange sites have already run into this problem and &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/questions/289/include-how-do-i-you-we-in-the-list-of-stop-words-for-search&quot;&gt;requested that these words be ignored by the site search&lt;/a&gt;. Google will also have figured this out, as they do everything they can to ensure that pages' ranks are determined by their usefulness rather than SEO games. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99195/151987&quot;&gt;as Jeff Atwood points out&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Google only supports a fixed # of words in the title of a page? Do you really want those eaten up by boilerplate?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare these titles, written as questions, then as summaries.

It includes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Keep it short&#xD;&#xA; - Lead with the most important words&#xD;&#xA; - Don't start with &quot;How do I&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles shouldn't be&#xD;&#xA;------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would go with &quot;neither&quot;. While it may initially sound like a good idea to make everything a question, it's ultimately misguided and counterproductive. Forcing titles to be questions forces the inclusion of boilerplate text. We want to avoid boilerplate for the same reasons that the word [&quot;question&quot; isn't allowed in titles](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/114224/151987) and [&quot;For issues relating to&quot; isn't allowed in wiki excerpts](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/116754/151987), and why [salutations are stripped](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93989/151987). The title is essentially the elevator pitch for the question. When skimming titles, **especially** in the &quot;Linked&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; sidebars, people want to easily tell what differentiates those questions so they know whether it really is related to their own problem. If they all start with &quot;How can I&quot;, &quot;How should I&quot;, &quot;How do I&quot;, then that makes it *harder* to tell them apart, not easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles should be&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question's title needs to be detailed, but succinct. Consider the titles of news articles or research papers. They need to convey the main thrust while fitting in a limited space. I wouldn't go so far as to change all titles that are questions to not be questions, but the added boiler plate is a hindrance to the goal of the title: to distinguish one question from others on similar subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To borrow from [my answer in The Great Debate](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99197/151987):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What we *really* want is for the title to be the well-described *subject*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (in the grammatical sense) of that question which starts with &quot;I need help to ...&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the example given, without more detail, I'd call it &quot;Painting a ceiling&quot;. Though I'd much prefer something like &quot;Applying oil-based paint to a textured drywall ceiling&quot;. Any words that *can* be omitted from the title without obscuring what the question is about, *should* be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Affects on searching&#xD;&#xA;--------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding search optimization, if all questions start with some variation of &quot;how do I&quot; then those words become useless as search keywords. Other Stack Exchange sites have already run into this problem and [requested that these words be ignored by the site search](http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/questions/289/include-how-do-i-you-we-in-the-list-of-stop-words-for-search). Google will also have figured this out, as they do everything they can to ensure that pages' ranks are determined by their usefulness rather than SEO games. Also, [as Jeff Atwood points out](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99195/151987): &quot;Google only supports a fixed # of words in the title of a page? Do you really want those eaten up by boilerplate?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples&#xD;&#xA;========&#xD;&#xA;Compare these titles, written as questions, then as summaries.

The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it [here](http://meta.diy.stackexchange.com/questions/890/2013-moderator-election-qa-questionnaire).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Q&amp;A with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is an alternative form of the Town Hall Chat system we've done [in previous elections](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/169754/february-2013-stack-overflow-moderator-election-town-hall-chat), we're trying some new things to test out how a different approach works. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's how it'll work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - During the nomination phase, (so, until October 28th at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post *one question per answer*.&#xD;&#xA; - We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.&#xD;&#xA; - This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.&#xD;&#xA; - At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select **up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community** provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.&#xD;&#xA; - Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.&#xD;&#xA; - This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have any questions or feedback about this new process, feel free to post as a comment here." />

It includes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Keep it short&#xD;&#xA; - Lead with the most important words&#xD;&#xA; - Don't start with &quot;How do I&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles shouldn't be&#xD;&#xA;------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would go with &quot;neither&quot;. While it may initially sound like a good idea to make everything a question, it's ultimately misguided and counterproductive. Forcing titles to be questions forces the inclusion of boilerplate text. We want to avoid boilerplate for the same reasons that the word [&quot;question&quot; isn't allowed in titles](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/114224/151987) and [&quot;For issues relating to&quot; isn't allowed in wiki excerpts](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/116754/151987), and why [salutations are stripped](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93989/151987). The title is essentially the elevator pitch for the question. When skimming titles, **especially** in the &quot;Linked&quot; or &quot;Related&quot; sidebars, people want to easily tell what differentiates those questions so they know whether it really is related to their own problem. If they all start with &quot;How can I&quot;, &quot;How should I&quot;, &quot;How do I&quot;, then that makes it *harder* to tell them apart, not easier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What titles should be&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question's title needs to be detailed, but succinct. Consider the titles of news articles or research papers. They need to convey the main thrust while fitting in a limited space. I wouldn't go so far as to change all titles that are questions to not be questions, but the added boiler plate is a hindrance to the goal of the title: to distinguish one question from others on similar subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To borrow from [my answer in The Great Debate](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99197/151987):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What we *really* want is for the title to be the well-described *subject*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (in the grammatical sense) of that question which starts with &quot;I need help to ...&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the example given, without more detail, I'd call it &quot;Painting a ceiling&quot;. Though I'd much prefer something like &quot;Applying oil-based paint to a textured drywall ceiling&quot;. Any words that *can* be omitted from the title without obscuring what the question is about, *should* be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Effects on searching&#xD;&#xA;--------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding search optimization, if all questions start with some variation of &quot;how do I&quot; then those words become useless as search keywords. Other Stack Exchange sites have already run into this problem and [requested that these words be ignored by the site search](http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/questions/289/include-how-do-i-you-we-in-the-list-of-stop-words-for-search). Google will also have figured this out, as they do everything they can to ensure that pages' ranks are determined by their usefulness rather than SEO games. Also, [as Jeff Atwood points out](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99195/151987): &quot;Google only supports a fixed # of words in the title of a page? Do you really want those eaten up by boilerplate?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples&#xD;&#xA;========&#xD;&#xA;Compare these titles, written as questions, then as summaries. The question form takes much longer to scan through, without improving your understanding of what you'll find when you click the link at all.

Though you're right that voting on **late** answers is poor, but I think that's more to do with factors other than simple voting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Abandoned Questions&#xD;&#xA;Many times somebody will drop in and ask a question, though they often will not have supplied all the details required to answer the question. In this case, the community will use comments to try and get more details. Unfortunately, this effort is often in vain and the asker has moved on, never to return.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some folks will throw out answers to these questions, hoping to get a few up votes. However, due to the lack of detail in the question, it's really impossible to provide an accurate answer. It seems voters are able to recognize this, and won't cast votes on the &quot;stab-in-the-dark&quot; answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Vote To Close - unclear what you're asking, is probably the appropriate response when you come across these questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Asking the wrong question&#xD;&#xA;Some folks will try to ask a question, but they'll ask it in a strange way, or ask the wrong question trying to beat around the bush.  This is very often the case where a user wants to ask an off topic question, but they know it's off topic. Instead of not asking at all, they try to make the question seem on topic. Or the user really doesn't know what to ask, but they need help so they give it a try. Again, the community will use comments to try and get at the heart of the problem. All too often though, both parties get frustrated and stop trying.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once again you'll probably get some &quot;stab-in-the-dark&quot; answers, but it's too late the question is lost. If you can get lucky, and your &quot;stab-in-the-dark&quot; answer hits the mark, the OP may return to reward you with a check mark. You may even get a few up votes, though don't expect a landslide of votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Buried by Crap&#xD;&#xA;Every once in a while (usually on weekends, when nobody is looking), a flood of questions will come in. Sometimes a good question (asked early), will be buried by a bunch of other questions. These are good questions, that can be answered, but they slipped by without being noticed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you can find one of these diamonds in the rough, you could end up with a check mark and a bunch of up votes. Though be warned, this is a rare case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Requires too much technical knowledge&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes questions are asked, that can only be answered by a user with lots of experience in that specific area. All other users just won't have the knowledge to provide a correct answer. If a person with said knowledge does not see the question, it too can be lost to the abyss. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, even if it's a good, popular question, and you provide a great answer. It's not likely to get many votes, since the general population really doesn't know what the answer is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;In the end, if you're looking to gain reputation on the site. Answering old questions is **not** the way to do it.  You could try the shotgun approach, and blast a bunch of questions with so-so answers. Get lucky and provide a decent answer to a really easy, really popular question, and get hundreds of up votes.  Or you can slog along, providing good answers, and slowly build up your reputation within the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just remember who your audience is. You're not answering questions for professionals in the field, you're talking to people who don't work in the industry, and are only doing the job themselves because they can't afford to pay for a professional (I'm speaking in generalities, of course. We're not all poor, inexperienced desk jockeys).  The real challenge is explaining highly technical information, that requires years of studying to understand, to the average everyday person. If you can do that effectively, you'll get lots of up votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />
