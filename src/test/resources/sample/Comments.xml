I only intentionally tried getting Suffrage once on another site - one in which I was very interested in the subject and already doing a lot of reading - and I must have spent two hours before I had read 30 Q&amp;As worth votes.  On a scattershot site like this, especially where the average quality seems lower, I can't imagine slogging through that much material in a 24-hour period!"
